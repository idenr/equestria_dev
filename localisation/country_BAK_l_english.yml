BAK_dealing_with_reactonaries:0 "A Dagger in the Dark"

BAK_judicial_socialisation_desc:0 "Bakara's republican legal codes are severely out of date for a modern society, and especially for a socialist one. We shall embark on a campaign of legal reform entrenching socialist policy in our legal system so that it will remain with our nation for many generations to come."
BAK_socialist_culture:0 "The Cultural Revolution"
BAK_socialist_culture_desc:0 "While Bakara's traditions of Republicanism are something socialists can look back on with pride, it is tainted by the effects of years of capitalist control and the evil influence of foreign powers who saw our system as a threat. With a few choice edits, we can offer an image of our republican past as one destined for socialism from the beginning, and that we continue that legacy."

BAK_economic_reorganisation_desc:0 "It is time to embark on our great economic reform of the nation! Socialism shall, of course, be the main focus, but branching out from there, we have many paths regarding how to proceed. Haze orthodoxy dictates we ready our weapons for the inevitable great conflict, but Bakara is deeply in need of more civilian goods. How we proceed is ultimately up to Bray."
BAK_homes_for_the_people:0 "Nopony Left Behind"
BAK_homes_for_the_people_desc:0 "One of the great issues that has plagued Bakara recently is its rapidly growing population. Nowadays, there is a large urban class that is either homeless or living on the very edge of bankruptcy. We draw a large base of support from this class, and so it is time we address their needs. New housing and social programs shall be implemented to assist these poor citizens."
BAK_peoples_railways:0 "Found the LKI" #Ljudski komisariat za infrastrukturu/People's Commissariat For Infrastructure

BAK_planned_economy:0 "Centralised Planning"
BAK_planned_economy_desc:0 "Orthodox revolutionary policy recommends a state-directed economic model from which we can better gear the nation up to increase production and streamline needless industrial bureaucracy.

BAK_worker_self_managment:0 "Worker Self Managment"
BAK_worker_self_managment_desc:0 "By employing a policy of industrial self-management, we can ensure that the workers in our factories are happy and productive. After all, the industrial state exists to benefit the workers not to oppress them. This may deviate us from the party line slightly, but we are sure we know what is good for the workers of Bakara."
BAK_collectivisation:0 "Collectivisation"
BAK_collectivisation_desc:0 "The efficiency of Bakara's agricultural production would be greatly increased if multiple farmers could be compelled to run their holdings as a joint enterprise. For the good of all citizens, we must implement a policy to integrate all individual landholding and labour into collectively-controlled farms."
BAK_agricultural_unions:0 "Cooperation"
BAK_agricultural_unions_desc:0 "Instead of embarking on a foolhardy program of economic repression, we must allow our citizens the freedom to self-organise and control their own destinies. Agricultural Unions should be allowed to form to protect and enhance the economic well-being and quality of life for farmers and their rural communities."
BAK_full_nationalisation:0 "All to the State!"
BAK_full_nationalisation_desc:0 "Guaranteeing the ascendency of the proletariat will require the nationalisation of all industries and the introduction of strict centralised management. The economic elite have had their run of oppression and exploitation for long enough. It’s time we expropriate the expropriators!"
BAK_limited_nationalisation:0 "Selective Nationalisation"
BAK_limited_nationalisation_desc:0 "Although it is called for by orthodox doctrine, complete nationalisation of all sectors of the economy would be far too disruptive to Bakaran society. Fortunately, we can still attain close to the desired effect with the nationalisation of a few key industries."
BAK_coopt_capitalists:0 "Coerce the Capitalists"
BAK_coopt_capitalists_desc:0 "Utilising such crude methods as forced dispossession would anger many and surely lead to massive resistance; a softer touch is called for. There is much that can be gained if we persuade the capitalists to help us of their own accord, using the threat of expropriation to motivate them."
BAK_the_split:0 "The Foam-Haze Split"
BAK_the_split_desc:0 "Bray Foam has bravely led us down a more compassionate path then the one demanded by harsh orthodoxy, bringing peace and prosperity to Bakara. But we can not close our ears to what is happening under Haze's dictatorship, nor the suffering of so many ponies. We have no choice but to accept the truth: Haze must be dealt with, for the good of the World Revolution."
BAK_passing_the_torch:0 "The Passing of the Torch"
BAK_passing_the_torch_desc:0 "It is a tragedy that Caramel Haze was not able to put his theories into practice himself. However, as long as we breathe, we will carry on his legacy and work tirelessly to bring about the liberation of all workers in the Riverlands. For Haze!"
BAK_maintain_orthodoxy:0 "Revolutionary Orthodoxy"
BAK_maintain_orthodoxy_desc:0 "Rejoice! Through our efforts and dedication we have transformed Bakara into a perfect realisation of Caramel Haze's revolutionary theories. Now, all that remains is for us to join hooves with Haze himself and work together to create a better future for every working pony."
BAK_war_of_liberation:0 "The Great Patriotic War of Unification"
BAK_war_of_liberation_desc:0 "Thus far, only a fraction of Riverlanders have been liberated from the chains of economic exploitation and political oppression; the forces of reaction still hold domain over the rest of the Riverlands.

BAK_proclaim_union:0 "The Triumphant Revolution"
BAK_proclaim_union_desc:0 "It was inevitable that our righteous cause would shatter the fragile tyranny of the Riverlands' corrupt old rulers, and so it did. Now workers across the Riverlands stand together in solidarity, in the United Socialist River Republics!"
BAK_unite_the_army:0 "Unite the Armies"
BAK_unite_the_army_desc:0 "The armies of the formerly independent Riverlander states will have to be integrated as soon as possible. This will be no easy task, as difficulties related to linguistic differences or old political rivalries are just a few of the obstacles we must account for."
BAK_unite_the_culture:0 "Pan-Riverpony Ethos"
BAK_unite_the_culture_desc:0 "The old corrupt rulers of the Riverlands did their best to keep us separated and stymie the development of a Riverlands-wide identity. This shall no longer be the case. We must take steps to nurture a shared culture and promote working class unity across the land."
BAK_destroy_reactionaries:0 "Destroy the Reactionaries"
BAK_destroy_reactionaries_desc:0 "In order to preserve the accomplishments of the Revolution and guarantee the security of our nation, decisive actions must be taken against all enemies of social progress. Whatever their motivation, wherever they hide and scheme, we will find them."
BAK_integrate_economies:0 "Integrate the Economies"
BAK_integrate_economies_desc:0 "The scars of war can still be seen all across the land. Repairing the damage will require fully integrating the disparate Riverlander economies, and transitioning them towards socialism away from their previous, inferior economic systems."
BAK_stronghold_of_socialism:0 "The Stronghold of Socialism"
BAK_stronghold_of_socialism_desc:0 "Our efforts have transformed the Riverlands into a strong and eternal union, a beacon of hope for all historically oppressed classes. Let it be known that the USRR stands firm against exploitation and oppression, and will forever be a force for justice in the world!"
BAK_strike_hillponies:0 "Liberate the Hillponies"
BAK_strike_hillponies_desc:0 "Although we have brought peace and prosperity to many, the ponies to our north still suffer and languish beneath oppression. These primitive and backwards hillponies would benefit greatly from integration into our Union."
BAK_strike_frontier:0 "The Iron Curtain"
BAK_strike_frontier_desc:0 "We Riverponies require a buffer to combat the growing threat of Griffonian Imperialism. The lands to our west are vulnerable and ripe for the taking, they will prove invaluable in the effort to fortify our nation against griffon aggression."
BAK_strike_south:0 "Liberate the Estuary"
BAK_strike_south_desc:0 "To our south lie a chaotic collection of misguided creatures toiling in confusion. It is our duty to help the lower classes of these lands by advancing their societies. If it requires crushing their tyrannical leaders to accomplish this, then so be it!"
BAK_a_greater_union:0 "A Greater Union"
BAK_a_greater_union_desc:0 "Under the impeccable leadership of Bray Foam, we have forged a union greater than anypony could have imagined, free from economic exploitation and political oppression.

BAK_fascists_win:0 "The Rise of the BFZ"
BAK_fascists_win_desc:0 "The ponies have spoken! Having heard our promise, they have given us an unambiguous mandate to purge the chronic weakness and corruption from the Bakaran government.

BAK_on_the_matters_of_economics:0 "On the Matters of Economics..."
BAK_on_the_matters_of_economics_desc:0 "Social and political instability has left the economy teetering on the brink of disaster.

BAK_state_unions:0 "Create the NZD" #Nacionalno združenje delavcev/National Worker Association
BAK_state_unions_desc:0 "It is time we did something about the troublesome trade unions; their socialist agitation has been extremely disruptive to the Bakaran economy. Rather than having multiple independent trade unions, there should be only one labour organisation under the direct control of the government, so that we may better harmonise the interests of workers and businesses."
BAK_price_controls:0 "Implementing Price Controls"
BAK_price_controls_desc:0 "The recent turbulence has seen prices for common household items spiral to absurdly high levels. We can not allow the exploitation of ponies by these greedy speculators to continue! Price controls will put a stop to such practices, while also helping to curb the threat of inflation."
BAK_militarise_economy:0 "Economic Militarism"
BAK_militarise_economy_desc:0 "Our task ahead demands that we reject the decadence of the old Bakaran status quo and militarise the economy. Beyond guaranteeing the security of our nation, an increase in military spending will boost our prosperity and raise the employment rate, due to increased demand."
BAK_scientific_advancement:0 "Restoring The Bakaran Academia"
BAK_scientific_advancement_desc:0 "As we strive towards creating a dynamic and modern society, we must not neglect the role of education. Achieving industrial and technological progress will not be possible if we fail to invest in universities and research institutes."
BAK_corporatism:0 "Corporatism"
BAK_corporatism_desc:0 "Utilizing corporate groups, the economy can be collectively managed by employers, workers, and state officials at the national level. Corporatism can better reconcile divergent interests into the state organically, leading to harmonious functioning and greater efficiency."
BAK_the_industrial_council:0 "The Grand Industrial Council"
BAK_the_industrial_council_desc:0 "We must recognise the importance of private initiative in organising society: the Grand Industrial Council shall be a body for representatives of all sectors of the economy to meet and resolve problems. This form of collective self-regulation will be far more effective than arbitrary government decrees."
BAK_massive_industrial_help:0 "Our Friends in the Factories"
BAK_massive_industrial_help_desc:0 "The Industrial Council has done an excellent job steering the economy, and many ponies on the Council have massively increased their wealth. Good for them!

BAK_on_the_matters_of_politics:0 "On the Matters of Politics..."
BAK_on_the_matters_of_politics_desc:0 "Our victory in the recent election must not make us complacent, there is still much work to be done. The rebirth of Bakara can not be accomplished without spreading the message of our new revolutionary civilisational order to every sector of society."
BAK_fascist_parliamentarism:0 "Reforming Parliament"
BAK_fascist_parliamentarism_desc:0 "We must tweak the rules of Parliament and change the electoral system to more accurately reflect the will of the ponies. Shifting away from proportional representation and towards majority representation will allow us to further solidify our control."
BAK_political_assistance:0 "Our Friends in the Capitol"
BAK_political_assistance_desc:0 "Thanks to savvy political manoeuvring, BFZ delegates are completely dominating Parliament! Their success in governing has left our enemies demoralised and incapable of putting up coordinated opposition. We should take this time to enlist their aid in furthering our larger project of national rebirth."
BAK_mixed_economics:0 "Good Old Fashioned Economic Principles"
BAK_mixed_economics_desc:0 "Rather than pursuing a radical and untested economic policy, we should stick with a stable blend of public and private enterprise. Using elements of both market and planned economies will allow us to best mediate between labour and business to promote national unity."
BAK_national_political_machine:0 "The National Political Machine"
BAK_national_political_machine_desc:0 "The political operatives of the BFZ performed admirably in the run-up to the election of 1007, but the complete renewal of Bakara will be an even more demanding task. The BFZ political machine must be restructured to gear it towards operating at a national level."
BAK_expand_radio_stations:0 "Officialise Radio Bakarska Enotnost"

BAK_legitimise_blackshirts:0 "Legitimise the Kovačinaši"
BAK_legitimise_blackshirts_desc:0 "The Kovačinaši is the best organisation for self-defence available for all patriotic Bakarans. However, as an extension of the BFZ, it is currently merely paramilitary. We have it in our power to make the Kovačinaši an officially recognised and supported militia organisation, which would greatly boost its prestige and power."
BAK_anti_communism:0 "Beating Back the Hydra of Socialism"
BAK_anti_communism_desc:0 "We must take a hard-line stance against the Marksist-Hazeists and their materialist nonsense. Their misguided focus on class identity is nothing less than a rejection of the emotional and spiritual bonds that hold our nation together. In the name of national solidarity, this ideology can no longer be tolerated!"
BAK_proper_autarky:0 "Autarky"
BAK_proper_autarky_desc:0 "A strong nation must strive to stand on its own economically. Relying on our external assistance or international trade rather than our own resources would be pure folly. Limiting trade and attaining self-sufficiency is critical to maintaining our national security. "
BAK_riverlands_the_nation:0 "Riverlands the Nation"
BAK_riverlands_the_nation_desc:0 "The Riverlands' petty and short-sighted leaders have long suppressed the Riverlander identity that binds us all together.

BAK_literally_the_ORPO:0 "Found the NP" #Naročite policija/Order Police
BAK_literally_the_ORPO_desc:0 "Traditionally, law enforcement in Bakara has been a local matter. This lack of centralised leadership and coordination has opened the possibility for chaos and disorder to spread rapidly. We must create an organisation to absorb all the police departments and get them under the control of the central government."
BAK_selective_philosophy:0 "Adapt the Way of the Waves"
BAK_selective_philosophy_desc:0 "Heavily influenced by our proximity to the sea, the Bakaran philosophical tradition has long emphasised the importance of resilience and social cohesion.

In response, BFZ candidate Firm Scow has released the following statement:\n\n"Rift Strain was a brave pony, outspoken in her love of liberty and an unflinching champion of the downtrodden, who was abruptly taken from us in a despicable and cowardly way. In light of this loss, we must not allow her cause to fade from our memories. She knew better than anypony that the River Coalition is not to be trusted. As she so famously wrote: 'It is a hypocritical institution not worthy of our faith, an institution which has given free reign to slavers and despots, and an institution which sits idly and stays silent while evil festers within it.'\n\n"She made it her mission to warn us that if we do nothing, there will come a time when all ponies of virtue are crushed beneath an iron hoof of injustice. Ponies like Tea Dip and Water Lily tragically refuse to heed this warning. And so it is my solemn pledge to Rift Strain's memory that, if elected, my first act will be to formally withdraw our Republic from the corrupt River Coalition, so that we may lay the foundation of a new, truly righteous order for the Riverlands.""

Their peaceful protest quickly turned ugly as armed militia members appeared on the side of the BFZ. The ensuing confrontation fortunately has not resulted in any deaths, but it is yet another symptom of Bakara's growing polarisation, and the nation is starkly divided as to which side should shoulder blame for the dust-up."

It is our duty to consider this matter carefully and come to a fair conclusion.\n\nBFZ spokesponies have decried the protests at Rift Strain's funeral as inappropriate and hugely disrespectful to the family of the slain pony. Those sympathetic to the ZDS have countered that the BFZ was the first to politicise her death, claiming that the inflammatory statement released by Firm Scow immediately after Rift Strain's assassination was bound to provoke a response. The question for us remains: should we side with the BFZ and condemn the communists for organising the protest, or should we defend the ZDS as merely exercising their right to free expression?"

It remains to be seen if the public will view this incident as the actions of a few bad ponies, or something which reflects a deeper corruption within the ZDS."

In a few minutes, she was set to go out and make a speech to a crowd of waiting citizens, and tell them her plans as their new leader. She straightened her tie. Not too casual, not too formal. Today she was the mare who needed to appeal to all Bakarans, not just her supporters. An aide brought her a cup of coffee, and she slowly sipped it. Her staff bustled about outside her office, preparing. Some feared a ZDS attack, but she knew that Foam wouldn't do anything that brazen.\n\nAn exhausted stallion entered. "Miss Scow, It's time."\n\nFirm sauntered out to her balcony, overlooking the crowd. Many of the closer ones cheered with enthusiasm, but many of those further back darted their eyes back and forth in worry. Many still considered her a radical, after all. Opening her mouth, she began to speak.\n\n"Ponies of Bakara! I am grateful for the chance you have given me to lead you into the future. We are at a turning point in our history, where the strong shall step above the weak and forge a new nation. Currently, our society is bound, held down by the elites who worship the River Coalition, but they have lost sight of its purpose! If they truly wished for Riverlands unity, they would bring the states together to create a greater destiny for all! But no, they want to control our nation from afar! They leave us as puppets to their establishment, which is now filled with monarchists and slavers! They let in those who would control and extort their own people! They try to separate the ponies of the Riverlands! To prevent us from achieving our true destiny of unification and the banishing of the old and corrupt order! I have fought for years to try to gain unity for the ponies, the dogs, and all the other citizens of the Riverlands! In this fight, I have seen the corruption of the establishment—how it lies through its teeth, how it says it wishes for "common prosperity." This is a lie. Their so-called “prosperity” is little more than slavery! It is submission to monarchs, it is domination by elites who care not for the common stallion or mare! I know they will not accept reason. With this, I declare that Bakara will no longer participate in the corrupt union that tries to control us. And that it shall be the goal of this nation to create a new union! A superior union! That shall unite all the Riverponies to achieve our true destiny! We shall enter a new era of greatness and opportunities! The coalition of Rijektograd has abandoned their mandate to bring together all the ponies of the east! And now Bakara must bear it! The dream of Riverland unity lives on in Bakara! Long live Bakara!

Bakara must free itself from the shackles it finds itself in one way or another.

The Navy had always been crucial to the nation's defense, and now its most respected Admiral openly berated the new government.\n\nStepping into a car outside the Naval port, Cobalt Wind took her seat beside the commander of the Republican Marine, Pearl Diver.\n\nThe Marine general took a deep breath and said, "Are we really planning this?

Making clear their intention to resist the progress Foam's regime brings for Bakara.\n\n"I knew they would resist us, but I didn't expect them to simply whine like fillies. It seems I almost expected more out of them. We are the new regime, we have a mandate to rule, it almost seeed we have cowed them. Maybe I will actualy get some sleep tonight.", he chucked to himself.\n\n"What about the Admiral sir?", an aid commented.\n\n"Cobalt Wind? She may have influence over the Navy, but we control the government now, and plus, her ships are not enough to remove us alone."\n\nAt this, a militiapony burst into the party office dashing towards Bray. "Mr. Foam! This is urgent, the Kovačinaši have gathered in Vetailje overnight. Tea Dip is there with them, and Water Lily hasn't been seen for hours."\n\nFoam's eyes widened, "You know what I am about to ask.

As the sea spray coated her Navy uniform, she had absolute confidence in the actions she would undertake today. The Admiral heard cursing from the shrubbery behind her as Tea Dip broke through the treeline covered in twigs and pine needles.\n\n"Admiral! Where have you been! I'm most likely putting my life on the line here for your little maneuver, and you are out here sightseeing?! Can I have some explanation?"\n\nThe Admiral said nothing for a moment and then replied, "They say some days you can see Greneclyf from there shores. I haven't personally, but I like to take it as a metaphor, if nothing else. We here in the Navy always look forward to bigger things than petty political squabbles. And now it is time to put that philosophy into action."\n\n"Oh in the name of all that is good, stop it with the esoteric nonsense. You are the head of a coup here. You have my financial support, Firm Scow is out somewhere gathering the rest of her militia, and Water Lily isn't going to be an issue. You told us all you have a plan. Now, what is it."\n\nThe Admiral turned and smirked, "That's the type of attitude I like. Now it is relatively simple, the Kovačinaši will push up on land, and the commies will engage them, then me the Peal Diver will sweep into Bakara proper on my capital ship with the Marines, and arrest Bray Foam. Easy."\n\nTea Dip blinked a few seconds. Before exclaiming sarcastically, "Oh, sure sure! Easy as Pie!" The Admiral snapped back, "I am the Military mare here.

bakara.27.t:0 "The Eye of the Storm"
bakara.27.d:0 "We finally have some good news out of the capital, as the brave soldiers of the Bakaran Revolutionary Militia faced down the counterrevolutionary Kovačinaši in fierce street fighting, winning a decisive victory. But that is not all: in the midst of the chaos, the traitor Cobalt Wind herself was apprehended alongside Pearl Diver, leading a small squad of marines intent on striking at the government's leadership. With these twin triumphs, the reactionary coup of Cobalt Wind and her co-conspirators has been utterly thwarted.\n\nFollowing the mobilisation of the Revolutionary Militia and the defeat of the coup, there has been a rush of admirals pledging their loyalty to the government and supporting the legitimacy of the election. Although their true loyalties may still not lie with us, the situation within the Navy has been quelled for the moment. The capture of Cobalt has dealt a hammerblow to the unified front organised by the opposition parties, who now have little hope of finding another leader popular enough to be acceptable to all three of the BFZ, SDH, and BSP. Active resistance continues, but fortunately the disparate rebel groups lack ordered leadership and coordination, and it is only a matter of time until they are isolated and neutralised.\n\nAlthough the immediate threat to its existence has passed, there is still no shortage of voices criticizing the government, not all of them residing within Bakara. Prominent members of the River Coalition's leadership have expressed harsh disapproval at the recent instability, refusing to outright back the mandate of the ZDS. This tacit support for Cobalt Wind and the other coup plotters has infuriated Bray Foam, who has decided to make good on his pledge and announced Bakara's immediate withdrawal from the River Coalition. Perhaps such a decisive action will boost our popularity slightly, although we still have a long way to go before fully consolidating the nation."

The mood was rowdy; most of the ponies in attendance were devoted party members or members of BFZ-aligned militias, still savouring their triumph in the recent election. But when Firm Scow approached the podium to speak, they swiftly fell silent out of respect for their leader.\n\n"Patriotic citizens of Bakara," began Firm Scow, "recent years have seen our nation suffer a long and slow decline caused by moral decay and decadence. Our victory gives us the chance to cleanse this decay. Together, we will reverse the decline and create a reborn Bakara, renewed by our communal spirit." Her tone was pointed and forceful, cutting through the warm air with its intensity. "This renewal will require devotion and sacrifice from every citizen, but what we will bring about is no less the dawn of a new cycle of history!" At this, the crowd stomped enthusiastically.\n\n"But not just for Bakara!" She raised a hoof emphatically. "We must foster the communal spirit of all creatures throughout the Riverlands, for we are all bound together by our eternal values and by our shared struggle against Griffonian Imperialism. Achieving this will necessitate slaying the morally bankrupt River Coalition." She brought her hoof down forcefully on the podium as the crowd booed and jeered at the mention of the Coalition.\n\n"The Riverlands are in crisis. The ponies must be saved from their current state of disintegration and injustice." Beads of sweat began to drip down Firm Scow's face: a result of her fervour. "It falls to us to combat the menace and unite them under a truly righteous banner. We shall see the Riverlands reborn!" Firm Scow raised her hoof high in the air.

Sky Chaser nodded in agreement. "We've had to endure much, you and I, but soon there will be order again — a new age. Rift Strain dreamt of a truly united Riverlands, and soon that dream will be a reality."

Three areas are singled out for special attention in her report:\n\nFirstly, the various armed forces which fought against us during unification have yet to be integrated into the Riverlander Army. These disintegrated armies represent an independent power base and unacceptable threat which may be used to undermine the Republic. Secondly, deep cultural divides remain in place along the old national borders. It will take some time to wipe away the ages of built-up enmity and misconceptions between our citizens. Thirdly, the economic systems developed by the other Riverlander states differ greatly from the superior economy we developed in Bakara. Truly efficient cooperation across the entire Riverlands will be stymied until our system is implemented across the Republic.\n\nAs long as these issues remain unresolved, they will continue to fester and threaten the unity of the Republic.

And here she was, in the brutalist Navy office, possibly to make a deal with the devil. Firm had never met the Admiral in person before this, but her intimidating silhouette has appeared all over recently, and Firm Scow had prepared herself for this.\n\nBeing let into the Admiral's office by a junior seapone, there was a striking difference in room design from the concrete bunkers and navy docks outside. The Admiral's office was covered in wood, with leather furniture and a fireplace behind a large oak desk, and of course, there was the Admiral herself.\n\nCobalt wind sat behind her desk in her Navy dress uniform, prepared to receive her guest with a fresh pot of tea. "Ah, Firm Scow! Please, take a seat." The Admiral had a smile on her face, not characteristic of her firm military persona, this was not a meeting of enemies clearly, but Firm Scow could not imagine them as friends. After all, was this not the mare who had thrown off her nation's democracy naught a few months ago?\n\n"Please, try not to feel out of place," the Admiral said, "if everything here goes well, I see you back here a lot more", Firm Scow pulled back, "Here a lot more? What in the world do you mean? And why did you even invite me here in the first place? You have banned all political parties, now I am nothing more than just another mare" Firm Scow squirmed in her seat, her plans for leadership had been dashed and what was to come next, was she to be humiliated?\n\n"Oh yes, the reason for you being here is simple, my regime is not yet fully strengthened. We still have many subversives to deal with, but there is a group I still trust, and that is your BFZ party. We have the same goals, in essence, strengthen Bakara, assist and protect her people. It was a simple choice for me, really." Firm Scow crooked her head to the side, "I have always wanted to lead Bakara. It was the wish of my father before me, and I have inherited his legacy. But we also accept the dream of a united Riverlands, and you have always been against tha-", "Stop." The admiral cut Firm Scow off, "I understand your belief in this idea of a united Riverlands. Applying your ideas far and wide, but you must accept that it can not happen. Why do you think the election turned out to be the firestorm it was? Because of all these foreign meddlers! The communists have always been supported by their "comrades" abroad, and arguments over our place in this Federation of ours caused violence on a huge scale, my intelligence has also shown me that foreign agitators have been responsible for much of the conflict rocking Bakara.", the ADmiral takes out sheets and sheets of reports and places them in front of Firm Scow, who in turn begins to shuffle through them\n\nAn intense redness overcomes Firm Scow, distress gnawing at her face, "How... communists from Rijektograd, donations to the BSP from Wittenland and Nimbusia?"\n\nCobalt Wind suddenly noticed something, her negotiation partner was... upset? She always knew that Firm Scow would not be comfortable with the loss of her political power, but this was genuine sadness? Cobalt Wind felt a strange compulsion in her chest, a warm throbbing to try to comfort this Mare, something she had never felt penetrate her cold steel military demeanor. Walking around her desk, she places a hoof on Firm Scow's shoulder, "Do not be too upset, you can still help Bakara. Come with me and help me lead Bakara into a new future, free from the slavers and communists from abroad, Bakara tried to open herself to the world, and the world rejected and abused her.

You will make Bakara proud." The Admiral chuckled, "Well, you are coming with me, of course? You will lead by my side, and maybe you can be by my side other places too?" Firm Scow jumped back at this and out of her chair, "Y-you what? I... I mean, I guess so. B-but, where would this be?"

Moving to Bakara city to pursue higher education, she became a teacher and was able to support herself and her new husband, a fellow university graduate. As a teacher, she became involved in her community and began to see the poverty that surrounded her in Bakara. In an attempt to amend this, she ran for the Mayorship of the city as a dark horse candidate and won against all the odds. It has been many years since then, and now Water Lily, the head of the SDH, must hold to her values and protect democracy and unity in Bakara against huge odds. This isn't just the classroom anymore. \n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"
POLITICS_TEA_DIP_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 968, Bakara City \n\n§YBiography§!: Tea Dip is the type of mare where you will never see a frown on her face. Endlessly charismatic and eternally suave, she rose up from a simple dock worker to the prodigal daughter of the CEO of the largest shipping company in Bakara. When he passed, she began a battle over company leadership with his biological son, eventually winning out through business guile, and a marriage proposal. With her new husband in tow, Tea prepared to do what she loved the most. Making obscene amounts of money. But to her dismay, she found herself liberated by the economic freedom allowed by the treaty of Coltstream, but stifled by the political aspects of the same body, and countless other Bakara merchants felt the same way. Finding something to fight for, she handed control of her company to her husband and used her wealth to found the "Bakarska Stranka Pravica" and has campaigned with it ever since. Now as leader of her nation she will finally have the chance to put her ideas into practice.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Ignacio"
POLITICS_BRAY_FOAM_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!:940, Marelje \n\n§YBiography§!: Son of a common laborer in the north-west of Bakara, Bray Foam quickly began to rise above the circumstances of his birth. Becoming fascinated with numbers and statistics, he eventually began to study economics in depth. He soon left his town to study this in Rijektograd and returned as a economic advisor to his community. But while in Rijektograd, he met a pony by the name of Caramel Haze. While at the time they both had little to do with politics, the meeting would change both their lives. They began a correspondence and slowly both adopted socialist ideas, with Foam becoming Haze's "2nd" in many ways. From there, Bray Foam became more and more involved in Bakaran politics, and one day, when the former de facto leader of the nation's socialists died in a mining strike, many turned to the modern educated economist in their midst. From there, Bray brought the Bakaran socialists closer to their brothers in the River Republic, but whether he keeps that course remains to be seen.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Twotail"
POLITICS_FIRM_SCOW_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 984, Bakara City \n\n§YBiography§!: Firm Scow is the inheritor of a legacy, and has a lot to prove to her family and her nation. The daughter of her party's previous leader, the infamous Scorch Scow, Firm has definitely made a name for herself separate from her father's legacy. While he was known to be curt and harsh, Firm is open and amenable. Where he shut the party's doors to all but the most fanatical, Firm opened the BFZ to the wider population. And this change in leadership marked a sea change for the party. Growing from a minuscule fringe under her father, Firm Scow has lead a massive expansion and is hailed as a leader many times that of her dad. But none would say this to her face, her father is many years dead now. Struck down by a "sleeping sickness". And despite her distant and often seriously troubled relationship with him, she guards his memory fiercely. And now Firm Scow stands at her nation's helm. Ready to guide it, and the Riverlands as a whole into a new age of prosperity and opportunity. And if it is not that easy, she only needs to remember her father's old adage, "Mares and stallions may say they don't want something. But there is always something that can convince them. Always." \n\n§YPortrait By§!: Vanilla Swirl"
POLITICS_COBALT_WIND_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 977, Vetailje \n\n§YBiography§!: Admiral Cobalt Wind has lived her life as almost all would expect. The daughter of two former admirals, she has grown up in the family profession and embraced her inherited role as Bakara's greatest Admiral. An intelligent mind with a knack for being in front of cameras, Cobalt has brought the Navy to the forefront of the Bakaran mindset once again, and has become a public figure in her own way. This is where her similarities to her parents end though, while they were generally a-political, Cobalt has never held her tongue on matters of national policy and has spoken out many times against government policies, while never directly aligning herself with any of the opposition parties. The one view she has made clear however, is her hatred of communism, which she sees as the cause of societal degradation, and has made a point of trying to keep socialist sympathies out of the Navy. But now it seems her life takes a new heading. As Bakaran head of state, Cobalt Wind will apply her military mindset to national governance. And her citizens can only guess how that will end up.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Silverstorm"
